# 03-JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Welcome to my Password Generator project!

[Click here to view on GitHub Pages](https://campbell-jk.github.io/03-JavaScript-Password-Generator/)

### For this project, we were asked to create a set of functions to randomly generate a secure password with the user's selection of length and characters.

### This week, we definitely saw the jump in difficulty the teachers had warned us were coming. Throughout programming this application, I would end up deleting whole sections of code and rewriting them as I tried to figure out the best approach for the features I was trying to apply.

### Here are the instructions we received in our README:

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

```

## Project Approach

---

### As I said earlier, my original approach on this project looked much different than my final project. Twice I completely scrapped it // copied the new thought process over to a new file.

### I received a lot of support from tutors and our class TAs, and even from my partner Rob who is a software engineer. When I had a really solid grasp of how I wanted to create my code, it all began to come together. I did take to the coding community by finally utilizing [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and got a lot of advice when I hit a hang-up on forcing my password to contain all of the selected characters. I love how willing to help the community is, and I will certainly be using them as a resource more often.

### The end result is a collaboration from several different approaches and, for myself, a lot of "a-ha!" moments!

## Final Thoughts

---

### My favorite part of JavaScript thus far is creating functions and conditional statements. I am actually really excited to begin using this to create some mind-blowing things.

### My partner Rob gave me a really fun metaphor to help understand how functions are working.

<br>

> Imagine you are on the wait staff of a restaurant

> Functions are like recipes that your restaurant is creating

> The arguments you put into the function are the ingredients you are wanting the recipe to contain

> The computer is the chef, but they will only cook with the ingredients (arguments) you provide them

> Creating a variable is like grabbing a bowl to hold or mix ingredients

> Using return in a function is like serving the completed dish back to whoever ordered (called) it

## Thank you for visiting my project!
